# Homework M3: Testing

Main goal is to build further on what was demonstrated during the practice

Prerequisites may vary between different tasks. You should adjust your infrastructure according to the task you chose to implement

## Tasks

Choose and implement one or more of the following:

- Try to implement as many of the remaining tests as possible to the respective **Gitea** or **Jenkins** pipeline

- Try to move from **monorepo** to **polyrepo** model

  - create a **repository per service**;

  - each repository should have a pipeline that tests the code and then builds the container image;

  - there is **[no need]{.underline}** to have any triggering or connection between the individual repositories

***\* The focus should be on achieving the required and not on doing it in the most automated way possible***

***\*\* Please note that even if you choose to implement more than one task, they may be quite independent and different. So, you may need to create a separate infrastructure (environment) for each or at least clean it every time***

## Proof

Prepare a document that shows what you accomplished and how you did it. It can include (**not limited to**):

- The commands you used to achieve the above tasks

- A few pictures showing intermediary steps or results

## Solution
1. [Task 1](./task1/task1.md)
2. [Task 2](./task2/task2.md)
