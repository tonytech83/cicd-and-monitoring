# Homework M2: Build Pipelines

Main goal is to build further on what was demonstrated during the practice

Prerequisites may vary between different tasks. You should adjust your infrastructure according to the task you chose to implement

## Tasks

Choose and implement one or more of the following:

- Create a **CI pipeline** (using **Gitea** or **Jenkins**) for a **NodeJS** application (in the supporting files) that **checks out** the code from **Gitea** repository, **builds** a container image (two tags -- **latest** and **commit SHA**), and **pushes** it to a local **Docker Registry** (insecure and without authentication)

- Create a **CI pipeline** (using **Gitea** or **Jenkins**) for a **Java** application (in the supporting files) that **checks out** the code from **Gitea** repository, **builds** a container image (two tags -- **latest** and **commit SHA**), and **pushes** it to a local **Docker Registry** (insecure and without authentication)

- Create a **CI pipeline** (using **Gitea** or **Jenkins**) for a **C#** application (in the supporting files) that **checks out** the code from **Gitea** repository, **builds** a container image (two tags -- **latest** and **commit SHA**), and **pushes** it to a local **Docker Registry** (insecure and without authentication)

**_\* Please note that even if you choose to implement more than one task, they may be quite independent and different. So, you may need to create a separate infrastructure (environment) for each or at least clean it every time_**

## Proof

Prepare a document that shows what you accomplished and how you did it. It can include (**not limited to**):

- The commands you used to achieve the above tasks

- A few pictures showing intermediary steps or results
